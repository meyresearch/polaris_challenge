## MolReBond
Transfer bond order information from reference SMILES to predicted molecule structure if the prediction model does not take into account bonds.

 The main code is in the `transfer_bond.py` file. The `test.ipynb` file shows how to implement the code.

I have used predictions from Boltz-1 in this case.
